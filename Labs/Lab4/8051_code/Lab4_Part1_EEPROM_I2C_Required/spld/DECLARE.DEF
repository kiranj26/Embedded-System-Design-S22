# White space and newlines are ignored.
# The file is divided into sections.  Each section begins with a
# Manuf name followed immediately by colon as in:
# INTEL:
# A series of entries follows where each entry is separated from the 
# next by a comma. 
# An entry begins with an identifier followed by either 1 or 2
# numbers. The first number is the type.  The second number is
# used with a type 3 entry as explained below.
# type 1 - Causes a property statement to be created in the PLA
#          file.  The property statement will have the number of
#          items as the first item.  This is used for fitters that
#          use this technique so they know how many items are in the 
#          list.  A type 1 entry is a MultipleEntity type meaning that
#          The declare statement can contain any number items.
#          example:
#          #$ PROPERTY MANUF ID 3 INPUTA INPUTB OUTPUTA

# type 2 - Used for XILINX FPGA support.

# type 3 - This is used for special DECLARE statements where the number
#          of items in the declare statement is fixed.  In this case, 
#          the second parameter is used to specify how many items to
#          expect.

# type 4 - Reserved. do not use.

# type 5 - This is similar to type 1 with one exception.  The count
#          of the number of items is omitted.
#          #$ PROPERTY MANUF ID INPUTA INPUTB OUTPUTA
